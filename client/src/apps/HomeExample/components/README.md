# Components

Components are common elements that can be reused elsewhere in the app by another module.

Each component directory contains one or more of the following:

* directives
* services
* filters
* other related files (HTML partials, styles, etc)

Common data (images, models, utility files, etc.) might also live under components (e.g. components/lib/), or it can be stored externally.

Components can have sub-component directories, including appended naming where possible.

Components may contain module definitions, if appropriate.
